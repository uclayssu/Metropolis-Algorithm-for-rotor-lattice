# Metropolis-Algorithm-for-rotor-lattice

These program were written in Cython. The cy_metropolis program is an implementation of the Ising model.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model

The other two programs are more sophisticated implementations of a model lattice with near-neighbor interactions (to the second NN). DFT calcuations were performed to explore the energetics of F2BODCA-MOF motion of a MOF crystal structure, which provides input for the Monte Carlo simulation. This Monte Carlo simulation was used along side experimental probes in order to infer about phase transitions and other physical properties such as electronic ground state of this rotor lattice. A visual simulation of the lattice is included in the program files.
